# global-entry-notify
This app will parse an input json to identify your appointment date and location, and then query the CBP's Trusted Traveler appointment availability API to check for any earlier appointment time slots. This code based on what I found on https://github.com/Drewster727/goes-notify, tweaked/modified to work with Python 3.9 and local execution only.
